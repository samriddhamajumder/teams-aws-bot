aws_services:
  ec2: "Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to launch virtual servers (instances) of different configurations and operating systems, scale capacity up or down based on demand, and only pay for what you use. EC2 supports automation through APIs, integrates with other AWS services like S3 and VPC, and offers multiple instance families optimized for compute, memory, storage, and GPU workloads."
  s3: "Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is industry-leading object storage for any amount of data. It offers scalability, durability, and low-latency access. S3 supports a range of storage classes to optimize costs (Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier, etc.), versioning to protect against accidental deletion, encryption for security, and integration with AWS Lambda for serverless data processing."
  vpc: "Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) lets you provision logically isolated sections of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a defined virtual network. You can define IP ranges, create subnets, configure route tables, gateways, and security groups to fully control traffic flow. VPC Peering and Transit Gateway allow connection across VPCs and accounts."
 #iam: "AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) securely manages access to AWS resources. IAM provides granular permissions using policies, user and group management, multi-factor authentication (MFA), access key rotation, and role delegation across accounts. It supports temporary credentials and works with AWS Organizations for multi-account governance."
  cloudformation: "AWS CloudFormation enables infrastructure as code. It automates the provisioning of AWS resources like EC2 instances, databases, networking, and security policies using YAML or JSON templates. CloudFormation supports reusable modules (Stacks) and automatic rollback for failed deployments."
  eks: "Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a fully managed Kubernetes control plane for deploying containerized applications at scale. It simplifies cluster management, automatically patches and scales your Kubernetes environment, integrates with AWS security and networking, and supports hybrid deployments with on-premise Kubernetes clusters."
  rds: "Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It supports popular engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server. Features include automated backups, patching, replication for high availability, and encryption at rest and in transit."
  dynamodb: "Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that offers fast and predictable performance with seamless scaling. It supports key-value and document data models, multi-region replication, on-demand backup and restore, and integration with Lambda for event-driven applications."
  lambda: "AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales and runs code in response to triggers from over 200 AWS and SaaS services. Lambda supports multiple runtimes (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, etc.) and charges only for compute time consumed."
  cloudwatch: "Amazon CloudWatch monitors AWS resources and applications in real time. It provides metrics, logs, and alarms to detect anomalous behavior, optimize performance, and troubleshoot operational issues. CloudWatch supports custom dashboards and anomaly detection with machine learning capabilities."
  sns: "Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service for sending alerts, notifications, and messages to distributed systems, applications, and users via email, SMS, or Lambda triggers."
  sqs: "Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables decoupling and scaling of microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It supports standard and FIFO queues with exactly-once message delivery."
  efs: "Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) provides simple, scalable, elastic NFS file storage for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. EFS automatically grows and shrinks as files are added and removed."
  route53: "Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It connects user requests to AWS infrastructure and external resources, supports domain registration, and offers routing policies for global traffic management."

instance_recommendations:
  test: "💡 For testing purposes, choose `t3.micro` (~$8/month). It provides low-cost compute resources for simple development or validation workloads."
  dev: "💡 For development environments, `t3.small` or `t3.micro` offers the perfect balance between cost and compute resources."
  prod: "💡 For production environments that require stable and consistent performance, go for `m5.large`, `m5.xlarge`, or `c5.large` depending on workload requirements and network throughput needs."
  experiment: "💡 For experimental workloads, quick tests, or personal learning, use `t3.micro` to keep costs minimal."
  staging: "💡 For staging or pre-production workloads that simulate production environments, `t3.medium` or `t3.large` gives optimal balance between price and performance."
  data_processing: "💡 For data processing jobs requiring higher compute power, consider `m5.2xlarge` or `c5.2xlarge` instances."
  machine_learning: "💡 For machine learning model training or inference workloads, use `g4dn.xlarge` or `p3.2xlarge` to leverage GPU acceleration."
  high_memory: "💡 For memory-intensive applica tions such as in-memory databases or caching workloads, consider `r5.large`, `r5.xlarge`, or `x1e.xlarge`."
  web_server: "💡 For small to medium scale web servers, `t3.medium` or `t3.large` instances are ideal."
  batch_jobs: "💡 For batch processing workloads that require short bursts of high compute, `c5.large` or `c5.xlarge` work efficiently."
